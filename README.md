Introduction
In this project, I will analyze Ratings and reviews for 15,000+ movies reviewed by Rotten Tomatoes.

Each record includes film details (title, description, rating, genre, directors, cast, release date, studio, runtime, etc.), as well as featured reviews, "Tomatometer" status, and audience ratings.

Explanation of rating category:
PG: Parental Guidance Suggested, Some Material May Not Be Suitable for Children.

R: Restricted, Children Under 17 Require Accompanying Parent or Adult Guardian.

NR: If a film has not been submitted for a rating or is an uncut version of a film that was submitted

G: General Audiences, All Ages Admitted.

PG-13: Parents Strongly Cautioned, Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under 13.

NC-17: No One 17 and Under Admitted.

What is a genre in a movie?
A film genre is a motion-picture category based (for example) on similarities either in the narrative elements or in the emotional response to the film (namely: serious, comic, etc.). ... Each film genre is associated with "conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_genre
